#Coding-Quiz

#Introduction

In this project, we built a coding quiz from scratch using HTML, CSS, & Javascript. 
The quiz needed a timer with a subtract time function for wrong answers and function to save your name and score to a leaderboard.


#Project Overview

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript fundamentals that store high scores.
Using different functions like


##Installation

Pushed the code into the github repository and deployed in into github pages.


##Usage

The start button will start the quiz. The questions will continue until you finish or the time runs out. 
You will be able to submit your name and save your score. The retry button should take you back to the home screen.

##Challenges Faced

Append Child was a real doozy to get to work lol.

##Lessons Learned

I learned how to create functions that had multiple commands and was able to use local storage to store and summon user info.

##Future Enhancements

Would like to come back to this project and finish the CSS and make adjustments to the Javascript.
